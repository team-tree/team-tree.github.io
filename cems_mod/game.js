Team Tree
Mod 1: Changed grid size to 6 by 5
Mod 2: created arrays of words to fit in the grid
Mod 3: Displayed the words as individual glyphs on the beads
Mod 4: The color of the beads are picked randomly out of an array of colors
Mod 5: The size of the glyphs depend on the length of the words

*I added a new cover.png file but it seems to not work properly on github for some reason*
